# Auto Layout
Because we will  be working with different screen sizes we must make use of AutoLayout features in UIKit framework.<br></br>

We'll first look at 2 features we have for autolayout. 
<ul>
    <li>Align
        <ul>
            <li>Aligning horizontally will align objects on the X axis. </li>
            <li>Aligning vertically will align objects on the Y axis.</li>
            <li>*NOTE: Setting these 2 is not enough, the object has to know it own size. We fix this by adding new constaints for X Axis (Width) and Y Axis (Height).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add new constraints</li>
</ul>
