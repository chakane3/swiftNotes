# Tableviews
This is the most used component in UIKit. They are used to present an ordered list of items. The ```UITableView``` class is responsible for presenting data as a list of rows. The data being displayed is called the table view's ```data source``` object which is accessed through the dataSource property. The data source can be any object that conforms to the ```UITableViewDatasource``` protocol. The table view's data source is typically the view controller which manages the view, the table view is a subview of. <br></br>

The table view is only responsible for detecting touches in the table view. Its not responsible for responding to the touches. The table view has a ```delegate``` property. This is how we will respond to the touches. By having a data source object managing its data and a delegate object handling user interaction, the table view focuses on data presentation. A data source object is similar to a delegate object:
<ul>
    <li>Delegate Object: Is delegated control of the user interface by the delegating object.</li>
    <li>Data Source Object: Is delegated control of data</li>
</ul>



## Introduction
###### Vocabulary
<ol>
    <li>cellForRow: This is a UITableViewDataSource method to describe the cell at a specific row/section in a UITableView</li>
    <li>numberofRowsInSection: Specifies how many object in the tableview.</li>
    <li>reuseIdentifier: String value used to specify a prototype cell in a table</li>
    <li>Protocol: This defined a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or functionality.</li>
    <li>Adoption/Confirming: Conforming a class to a protocol. </li>
</ol>

We absolutely need ```cellForRow``` and ```numberOfRowsInSection``` for data to come into our tableview. 

# Demo
We can start off with a new xcode project (single view app). We will need to look into the Storyboard first:
<ol>
    <li>Embed a Navigation Controller in the root View Controller.</li>
    <li>Place a Table View in the Root view Controller</li>
    <li>Make sure the cell in the table view has a reuseIdentifier</li>
</ol>

This will be our initial model.

<summary>Country Model</summary>

```swift

  let name: String

  let countryCode: String
  
  // Country.countries
  static let countries = [

### Connecting Storyboard UI to View Controller
We use ```CTRL + drag``` on UI elements in Swift which will add an ```@IBOutlet```. This is how we can extend functionality to our UI elements. Once we configue this we should have something that looks like this: 
```swift
@IBOutlet weak var tableView: UITableView!
```

### Using the model

In our view controller we will need to bring in our data (Country model).
```swift
// didSet is a property observer (listener) used to reload the tableView. 
// If the countries propertyChanges then the tableView reloads
// this is because we are going to add functionality to sort the data
private var countries = [Country]() {
    didSet {
        tableView.reloadData()
    }
}
```

### Setting the DataSource Object
In our viewDidLoad function we want to send data to our tableview once the view is present. We would have to add this oine of code in the function:
```swift
tableView.dataSource = self // self is the ViewController instance
```

### Confirming to UITableViewDataSource
When we conform to protocols, by convention, we write extensions to the ViewController for code readability. In this case, we will write one ourside the ViewController class in our swift file. ```UITableviewDatasource``` is a protocol with methods to help us configure content in our table view. Theres 2 required methods for the protocol:
<ol>
    <li>numberOfRowsInSection: how many cells</li>
    <li>cellForRowAt: whats inside the cell</li>
</ol>

```swift
extension ViewController: UITableViewDataSource {
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        return countries.count
    }

    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReuseableCell(withIdentifier: "countryCell", for: indexPath)
        let country = countries[indexPath.row]
        cell.textLabel?.text = country.name
        cell.detailTextLabel?.text = country.countryDescription
        return cell
    }
}
```

#### Using IndexPath
IndexPath is an object provided by UITableView and is how we will iterate through our model. For example lets say we have an array of arrays
```swift
let arrayOfArrays = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] ] 
arrayOfArrays[indexPath.section][indexPath.row]
```
If were working with a 1D array we can do this
```swift
let flatArray = [1, 2, 3]
flatArray[indexPath.row]
```
