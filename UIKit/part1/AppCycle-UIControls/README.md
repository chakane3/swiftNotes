# App Lifecycle Methods & UI Controls
When we setup a brand new application we will have 3 files we could write code in.
<ul>
    <li>SceneDelagate</li>
    <li>AppDelegate</li>
    <li>ViewController</li>
</ul>

###### ViewController
###### SceneDelegate
###### AppDelegate

## UI Controls
We'll start off with a navigation controller.
```UINavigationController``` - manages a stack of view controllers which allows us to navigate through different screens in the app.
