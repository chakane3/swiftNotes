In this repo are all the projects to help me document my learning 
| Project | Summary |

| Basics of UIKit | Learn how to use tableviews, buttons, pass data, protocols, delegation, other built-in UI functions, images, etc. |
|<a href="https://github.com/chakane3/swiftNotes/tree/main/Pursuit-UIKit/Unit2/zooAnimals">zooAnimals</a> | Create an app to view our zoo animal data in 3 different ways. One in a basic tableview subtitle cell, another, in a custom tableview cell, and lastly a tableview with custom cells that are in sections. We also create a detail view controller and use a segue to pass data from one file to another. |
