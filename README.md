# swiftNotes

In this repo are all the projects to help me document my learning 
| Project | Summary | original |
| ----------------------------- | --- | --- |
| Basics of building an app | Learn how to use tableviews, buttons, pass data, protocols, delegation, other built-in UI functions, images, etc.<br> This also goes over json parsing, using an API, URLSession, closuures, wrapper classes, handling requests, and other UI implementations| yo |
|<a href="https://github.com/chakane3/swiftNotes/tree/main/Pursuit-UIKit/Unit2/zooAnimals">zooAnimals</a> | Create an app to view our zoo animal data in 3 different ways. One in a basic tableview subtitle cell, another, in a custom tableview cell, and lastly a tableview with custom cells that are in sections. We also create a detail view controller and use a segue to pass data from one file to another. |
| <a href="https://github.com/chakane3/swiftNotes/tree/main/Pursuit-UIKit/Unit2/appLifeCycle">appLifeCycle</a>  | Create an app that demonstrates app lifecycle methods. We also implement a slider, stepper, and switch. |
| <a href="https://github.com/chakane3/swiftNotes/tree/main/Pursuit-UIKit/Unit2/scheduler">Modifying table views/Data Persistence</a> | Create an app to have a user create a new entry on our TV and be able to exit the app and go back in to see the data the user saved. |
| <a href="https://github.com/chakane3/swiftNotes/tree/main/Pursuit-UIKit/Unit2/stories">topstories</a> | Create an app to parse local JSON, more on tableViews and searchbar methods; filtering, segues | 
| <a href="https://github.com/chakane3/swiftNotes/tree/main/Pursuit-UIKit/Unit2/tdd">Unit Testing</a> | test driven development |
|<a href="https://github.com/chakane3/swiftNotes/tree/main/Pursuit-UIKit/Unit2/getR">network requests pt1</a> | singleton design pattern, closures, URLSession and creating a wrapper class for it. Example app is to fetch jokes from an api |
| <a href="https://github.com/chakane3/swiftNotes/tree/main/Pursuit-UIKit/Unit2/concurrency">concurrency-GCD</a> | Intro to combine framework, concurrency, granf central dispatch. App to load images |
| <a href="https://github.com/chakane3/swiftNotes/tree/main/Pursuit-UIKit/Unit2/Recipies">Recipies</a> | Implement topics from previous projects: search bar, network requests, APIKeys, concurrency, etc | [<a href="https://github.com/chakane3/takeHome">takeHome</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chakane3/swiftNotes/tree/main/Pursuit-UIKit/Unit2/MusixMatch">MusicxMatch</a>, <a href=https://github.com/chakane3/MetMobile">MetAPI</a>  ] |
